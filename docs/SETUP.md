# Setting Up
Getting up and running is easy. Make sure you have several GBs of storage free, as the model weights and add-on consume a lot of storage space.

In general, all of the instructions you need to setup will be given within Blender. However, if you want to see screenshots and more explanation this can be helpful.

If you have any problems, you can open an issue.

## Installation

See the [release notes](https://github.com/Firework-Games-AI-Division/dmt-meshes/releases/latest) for the most recent version of DMT Meshes. There you will find a section titled "Choose Your Installation". Use the dropdowns to find the right version for your system.

After you have the add-on installed in Blender, check the box in Blender preferences to enable it. Then follow the steps below to complete setup.

> **NOTE:** The first run may take a few minutes as we download the pre-trained model from openai/point-e. If you want to see the progress, go to Windows -> Toggle System Console.

> **DO NOT** try to install dependencies. Tools for doing so are intended for development. *Always* [download a prebuilt version](https://github.com/Firework-Games-AI-Division/dmt-meshes/releases/latest).
